                <p>
                    The SS Great Britain is one of the most important historic
                    ships in the world, and Bristol’s top tourist attraction.

                    Working with my team at Atomic Smash, I completely
                    redesigned the organisation’s website to launch a more
                    engaging, dynamic site for visitors to find inspiration and
                    plan their visit.
