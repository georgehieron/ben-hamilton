excerpt: Bristol / City of ... is a series of alternative guides to inspire its
  reader to explore Bristol via the senses. *Smells* is the first in the series
  and offers writing, places to visit and top tips for anyone equipped with a
  nose.
summary: I created a brand for the series and designed this first issue. The
  aesthetic is inspired by home made zines and pamphlets, to reflect the the
  *on-a-budget* nature of the publication itself.

    quote: The layered textures and colours are taken from the pastel shades of
      copier paper you might find scattered on the floor of a photocopy room,
      while the glitchy title text comes from a print-out I manipulated on a
      photocopier. I wanted the typography to reflect the low-fi, default
      styling (typically Times New Roman) found in the newsletters and pamphlets
      that might get stuffed through your letterbox by a local community group.
