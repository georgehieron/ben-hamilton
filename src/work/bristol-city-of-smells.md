    quote: The aesthetic is inspired by home made zines and pamphlets. The layered
      textures and colours are taken from the pastel shades of copier paper you
      might find scattered on the floor of a photocopy room, while the glitchy
      title text comes from a print-out I manipulated on a photocopier. I wanted
      the typography to reflect the low-fi, default styling (typically Times New
      Roman) found in the newsletters and pamphlets that might get stuffed
      through your letterbox by a local community group.
