excerpt: "I created this 3D illustration as a suite of social media assets to
  announce the launch of this website. The tableaux depicts the site in an
  abstract/unreal setting, contrasted with some of the very real-world tools i
  used to create it: namely pens and pencils."
summary: The illustration was created in collaboration with my brother in Cinema 4D.
