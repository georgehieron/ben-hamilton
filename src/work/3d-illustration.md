excerpt: "I created this 3D illustration for a suite of social media assets to
  announce the launch of my website. The tableaux depicts the site in an unreal
  setting, contrasted with some of the very real-world analogue tools I used to
  create it: namely pens, pencils and of course erasers for the mistakes I made
  along the way."
summary: The illustration was created in collaboration with Cinema 4D whizzkid
  (and also my brother ðŸ˜‰) James Hamilton.
