excerpt: "I created this 3D illustration as a suite of social media assets to
  announce the launch of this website. The tableaux depicts the site in an
  unreal setting, contrasted with some of the very real-world analogue tools I
  used to create it: namely pens, pencils and of course erasers for the mistakes
  I made along the way!"
summary: The illustration was created in collaboration with my brother James who
  is a Cinema 4D whizz.
